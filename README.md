# model-collapse

Tests model collapse from training on synthetically-generated data in a random forest model. 
The wine_full_synthetic.ipynb and credit_full_synthetic.ipynb files test that. 
The copy files of them do the same thing with modified random seeds for the train/test splits to get a wider range of results.
